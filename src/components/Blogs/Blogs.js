                    <p>authentication is the process of verifying who someone is, whereas authorization is the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can come on board.</p>

                                <li>Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</li>
                                <li>Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.</li>
                                <li>Authorization always takes place after authentication.</li>
                                <li>Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</li>

                                <li>Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user.</li>
                                <li>Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.</li>
                                <li>Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.</li>
